# crosslink_topologies
**Algorithms for efficient crosslink communication for Distributed Systems Missions. Code written by Brin Harper, Maryann Rui, and David Dezell Turner.**

The orbital data for each satellite constellation can be found in the **satellite_graph_lists** folder. Each of the MATLAB files in this folder has one container variable, which the message routing scripts use for testing. The keys are ints representing each timestep, or the number of seconds since the start of the scenario. The values are adjacency matrices. For each adjacency matrix *A*, *A<sub>i,j</sub>* is equal to the slant range between satellites *i* and *j* in km if there is an unobstructed line of sight between them. *A<sub>i,j</sub>* = 0 otherwise. (These files were created by running **lunar_constellation_test.m** and **dataToGraph.m**.)

To generate orbital data for new satellite constellations, use/modify the script **lunar_constellation_test.m**. This script generates a constellation around a specified central body, then creates a .xlsx file containing the distance between each pair of satellites at each timestep (but only during time intervals where the pair of satellites have a direct line of sight between them). Use **dataToGraph.m** to convert that .xlsx file into a MATLAB container variable that can be used in the message routing scripts. For an example of how to use **dataToGraph.m** or the existing container files in the **satellite_graph_lists** folder, look at **csv_test.m**.
